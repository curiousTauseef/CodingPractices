1. Remove duplicates from sorted array 1 and 2, remove element(Two pointers,
one direction)(implementation)

2. Remove duplicates from sorted list 2. One loop solution is not necessary.
Two loops can be even better. (implementation)

3. When you expect to do some kinds of searching within linear time, always
remember to try constructing a hash set/map first, so that you can have enough
background information beforehand. Leetcode: Longest Consecutive
Sequence(algorithm). However sometimes it might be easier to search while
iterating. Leetcode: Two Sum

4. Finding two elements whose sum is equal to the target value can be done
using two pointers iterating from two ends to the middle in
linear time if the array is already sorted(duplicates are allowed).
Leetcode: Three Sum

5.Four Sum(Algorithm)
